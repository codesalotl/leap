INTRODUCTION
Sec. 1. Basis. The Chart of Accounts as Object Code in the Unified Accounts Code
Structure (UACS) is based, primarily, on the following:
a. COA Circular No. 2013-002 dated January 30, 2013 prescribing the adoption of the
Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) for National Government Agencies (NGAs)
effective January 1, 2014;
b. COA Resolution No. 2014-003 dated January 24, 2014 prescribing the adoption of
the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS);
c. COA Circular No. 2014-003 dated April 15, 2014 providing the implementing rules
and guidelines on the Conversion from the Philippine Government Chart of Accounts
under the New Government Accounting System per COA Circular No. 2004-008
dated September 20, 2004, as amended, to the Revised Chart of Accounts for NGAs;
d. COA-DBM-DOF Joint Circular No. 2013-1 dated August 6, 2013 prescribing the
UACS; and
e. COA-DBM-DOF Joint Circular No. 2014-1 dated November 7, 2014 providing the
enhancement of UACS prescribed under COA-DBM-DOF Joint Circular No. 2013-1.
During the initial implementation of the PPSAS and the UACS, and during the
finalization of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs, the need to provide
additional accounts for some financial transactions and to modify some existing account codes
and description came about. These revisions will enable the agencies to properly recognize and
present their financial transactions. This Chart of Accounts as Object Code in the UACS, Volume
III of the GAM for NGAs, includes additional and modified accounts.
Sec. 2. Contents. This Volume consists of the following:
a. Chapter 1 – Introduction
b. Chapter 2 – List of Accounts
This contains the lists of accounts per RCA and the additional accounts
prescribed under COA Circular No. 2014-003. The codes per RCA, UACS sub-codes
and the combined codes or the UACS object codes were presented.
c. Chapter 3 – Description of Accounts
The descriptions of all the accounts in the list are presented, except for the subobject codes in the UACS. These sub-object codes shall follow the description of the
RCA account.
